## Welcome to Ethen's GitHub Page

This page is to showcase my many different projects made in my Software Development Class.

### Clever Programmer

The Clever Programmer Project was a part of a rotation in the class. This included video lessons followed by a Turtle Art Project, as well as a Rock, Paper, Scissors program.

Turtle Art Project
  The Turtle Art Project (shown on the top of the website) used a basic "for i in range" code that implemented angles and movements (along with penup and down, to create a very interesting star-like drawing. 
 
Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) Game
  The Rock Paper Scissors Game was a bit more difficult to make. It involved more thought and using a random interger selection between 1-3 and assigning Rock ('r') to 1, Paper ('p') to 2, and Scissors ('s') to 3.
  
  Here is the link to the RPS game code:

### Microbit / Cyber Security Rotation

###### Microbit (Days 4-6)
  The Microbit project was definitely interesting. I think that working with this stripped down computer was fun! Using lights and some fun coding, I was able to produce a counter. This counter uses an "A" button, a "B" button, and uses both "A" and "B" buttons to count forward, backward, and reset the count respectively. 

Here is a link to the code:
