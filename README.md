## Welcome to Ethen's GitHub Page

This page is to showcase my many different projects made in my Software Development Class.

### Clever Programmer

The Clever Programmer Project was a part of a rotation in the class. This included video lessons followed by a Turtle Art Project, as well as a Rock, Paper, Scissors program.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EthenWilson/ethenwilson.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
