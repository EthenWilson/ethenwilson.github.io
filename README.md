## Welcome to Ethen's GitHub Page

This page is to showcase my many different projects made in my Software Development Class.

### Clever Programmer

The Clever Programmer Project was a part of a rotation in the class. This included video lessons followed by a Turtle Art Project, as well as a Rock, Paper, Scissors program.

```markdown

Turtle Art Project
  The Turtle Art Project (shown on the top of the website) used a basic "for i in range" 
  code that implemented angles and movements (along with penup and down, to create a very 
  interesting star-like drawing. 
 
Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) Game
  The Rock Paper Scissors Game was a bit more difficult to make. It involved more thought
  and using a random interger selection between 1-3 and assigning Rock ('r') to 1, Paper 
  ('p') to 2, and Scissors ('s') to 3.
  
  Here is the link to the RPS game:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EthenWilson/ethenwilson.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
